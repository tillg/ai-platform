# AI Platform
A platform to tinker around with Vector Databases, Prompts and Chats.

In order to play with it we have stuff:
* Vector DBs packaged in **Brains** that you can search
* **LLM**'s all over the place
* **Prompts** that we can modify ant test
* **Orchestration** that combines it all in chains - Brains, prompts and chats...

This is how the different bits are interacting:
